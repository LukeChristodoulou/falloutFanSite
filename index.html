						<p>The original creators, Black Isle Studios created a very unhinged game. What do I mean by that? I mean that the game was ruthless black comedy, everything was out to kill you and you could do almost anything that came to mind and the game would happily oblige with a smile, may that be kill an entire village of innocence, blackmail cannibals, or be a good boy and save your vault. </p>

						<p>The second game is the fan favorite even though the beginning is widely accepted as being the worst and off putting. The game was more of the same but bigger, funnier and a much cleaner interface.</p>

						<p>Unfortunately BIS went bankrupt during development of what was at the time, Fallout 3, codename: Van Buren. It was meant to be the first 3-D take on Fallout that game players the option to play in real time or turn based and include optional Co-op playability.</p>

					<p>In 2004, a year after Black Isle Studios went bankrupt, Bethesda bought the IP that was Fallout and 2008 came around and they released Fallout 3. Not Van Buren, but their own version of Fallout that they had turned into a real time first person shooter.</p>

					<p>Fallout New Vegas was meant to be filler content for people while Bethesda was creating their next mainline entry but ended up being something bigger. Bethesda gave the right to make a Fallout game to Obsidian, whose members were composed of former Interplay and Black Isle Studio members. Meaning that the original workforce for Fallout 1 and 2 were back to create a new piece of Fallout history. </p>

					<p>7 years after Fallout 3, Fallout 4 had been released. And it was well welcomed at first. Cleaner version of the engine (meaning better movement and gunplay), a better crafting system, a building system and over 75 hours of estimated playtime. All seemed well at first given that people were craving for a new Fallout experience but after a few hours something seemed off, like it wasn't Fallout.</p>

					<p>Then out of nowhere, Bethesda whipped out ANOTHER Fallout game, only 3 years after 4. Assuming it was another filler game like New Vegas, the Fallout community cheered considering that 4 wasn't the best and could use a few improvements. But unfortunately this entry was unlike any other in the franchise.</p>
